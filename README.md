In this Spotify Music Analysis I have developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, the goal is to provide stakeholders with a user-friendly tool to analyze streaming trends, track performance metrics, and gain deeper insights into artist popularity
Data Used: Spotify Dataset(Onyx)
Key insights:
Data Analysis and Cleaning:
•  Obtained Excel data from Onyx and created a table in the table view.
•  Removed errors in the Power Query Editor and replaced null values to ensure data accuracy and completeness.
•  Utilized Power BI's powerful data transformation tools to normalize and refine the data for insightful analysis.
Dashboard Visualizations:
•	The dashboard uses cards to showcase total streams, total tracks, and average streams, providing a quick and easy overview of key performance metrics. 
•	Implemented slicers for tracks, date, artists, and top 5 most streamed artists to allow dynamic filtering and exploration of the data.
•	Created a line chart to visualize streams by release date, providing a clear view of streaming trends over time.
•	Developed bar charts to display daily streams, offering a detailed breakdown of streaming activity.
•	Highlighting the most streamed tracks for each artist, along with detailed music information.
🎨 Custom Canvas Background:
