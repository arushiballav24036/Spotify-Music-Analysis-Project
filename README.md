## Tools used :
- Excel
- PowerBI
- Power Point
  
In this Spotify Music Analysis I have developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, the goal is to provide a user-friendly tool to analyze streaming trends, track performance metrics, and gain deeper insights into artist popularity
## Data Used: Spotify Dataset(Onyx)
## Key insights:

### Data Analysis and Cleaning:
- Obtained Excel data from Onyx and created a table in the table view.
- Removed errors in the Power Query Editor and replaced null values to ensure data accuracy and completeness.
- Utilized Power BI's powerful data transformation tools to normalize and refine the data for insightful analysis.
  
### Dashboard Visualizations:
-	The dashboard uses cards to showcase total streams, total tracks, and average streams, providing a quick and easy overview of key performance metrics.
-	Implemented slicers for tracks, date, artists, and top 5 most streamed artists to allow dynamic filtering and exploration of the data.
-	Created a line chart to visualize streams by release date, providing a clear view of streaming trends over time.
-	Developed bar charts to display daily streams, offering a detailed breakdown of streaming activity.
-	Highlighting the most streamed tracks for each artist, along with detailed music information.
  
### Custom Canvas Background:
-	Designed a visually appealing canvas background using PowerPoint to enhance the dashboard's aesthetic.
-	Incorporated branding elements and a cohesive color scheme to create a professional and engaging visual experience.
-	Ensured the background complemented the data visualizations for clear and effective communication.
